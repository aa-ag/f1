# F1 🏎️

Found an [Formula One data](https://www.kaggle.com/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020?select=lap_times.csv) set in Kaggle and could not resist.  Will play around with data to see what interesting stuff comes up. 

## env

- `conda create -n f1`
- `conda install python`
- `conda install pandas`
- `conda install jupyter`
